//! This module contains the syntax of AxCut. At its core, it is a one-sided sequent calculus with
//! user-defined (co)data types and top-level function definitions. It is fully focused, meaning
//! that all terms in argument positions are variables. The only terms are statements which
//! represent computations. The statements are implemented in such a way that they support a
//! non-linearized version with arbitrary variable usage and a linearized version with explicit
//! substitutions.
