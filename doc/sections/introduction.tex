This article is structured as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item In \cref{sec:fun} we introduce the surface language Fun.
    \item In \cref{sec:core} we introduce the intermediate language Core.
    \item In \cref{sec:translation} we show how to translate programs from the surface language Fun to the intermediate language Core.
    \item In \cref{sec:naming-transformation} we show a transformation on programs in Core which names all intermediate computations, similar to ANF or focusing transformations.
\end{itemize}
