This article is structured as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item In \cref{sec:fun} we introduce the surface language \surfacelang.
    \item In \cref{sec:core} we introduce the intermediate language \targetlang.
    \item In \cref{sec:translation} we show how to translate programs from the surface language \surfacelang\ to the intermediate language \targetlang.
    \item In \cref{sec:naming-transformation} we show a transformation on programs in \targetlang\ which names all intermediate computations, similar to ANF or focusing transformations.
    \item In \cref{sec:axcut} we introduce the low-level intermediate language \machinelang.
\end{itemize}
We discuss related work in \cref{sec:related-work} and conclude in \cref{sec:conclusion}.
